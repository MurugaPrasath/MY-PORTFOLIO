    <H2>Hello! I’m Muruga Prasath, a dedicated front-end developer with a strong passion for crafting visually appealing and user-centric web experiences. I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in B.E ECE from Jeppiaar Engineering college July 2024, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. My academic journey and personal projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in creating responsive and accessible websites.

        What excites me the most about front-end development is the blend of creativity and logic it requires. I enjoy taking on challenges that push my problem-solving abilities and allow me to experiment with new design techniques and technologies. My approach is centered around delivering clean, efficient, and well-structured code that enhances the user experience.
        
        I am always eager to learn and grow, staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry. I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage innovation and continuous improvement. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring tech blogs, participating in online forums, and contributing to the development community. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact and to continue growing as a developer.</H2>
